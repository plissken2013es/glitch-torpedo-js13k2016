## Context

"Glitch torpedo" is my 2016 [js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com/entries/2016) submission, a multiplayer sea battle online arcade game, based on Gremlin's "Depthcharge" arcade machine (1977). 
The goal of the compo is to make a game in less than 13k of zipped JavaScript. Theme was "glitch". 

## Instructions:

Ship commander may use LEFT/RIGHT arrows (or A and D keys) to move destroyer. 
Z and X keys launch depth charges (M and N does the same).
The ship has 5 charges available, reloaded on explosiones.
Each submarine sunk scores differently.

Submarine commander does not control movement of subs, but may launch torpedoes from
any of them by using number keys (1 to 8). The deepest torpedo launches score more points.
Moreover, Sub player may enter "Silent running" mode by pressing SPACE once per game: 
the subs will become invisible to the Ship player for a few seconds.

When time is over, the best score wins.

Important note: remember that this is and old arcade machine and some undesired bugs or
"glitches" may appear occasionally.

Good luck, Captain!

# Tech overview

- Canvas2D is used for all the drawing
- [jsfxr.js](https://github.com/mneubrand/jsfxr) for the audio (5 sounds)
- Socket.io server logic based on [js13kgames server](https://github.com/js13kGames/js13kserver)

## Making the server logic

> A non exhaustive summary about the server and the client doing their thing

Last year, I spent a lot of time creating a [brand new game featuring "shiny" mechanics](http://js13kgames.com/entries/battle-of-mages-in-the-unireverse) and couldn't add the server logic at the very end.
This time, I wanted to do differently. So I started by creating the working local 2-player version of the game in a few days, and then direct all my efforts to do the server magic (one thing I had never did before). 

### Only two players per room

Basically, when a player arrives to the server and enters his/her name, looks for any non-paired player that arrived before. If found, the player that was waiting will take the "destroyer" role and the incoming player will be the "sub commander".

If there's no available player, the incoming user will add to the queue and wait for a new player to come. He/she will play as "destroyer captain" when this happens.
